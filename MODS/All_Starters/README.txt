# All Starters #
A mod that adds starters from all PMD games (including the WiiWare ones), as well as the starters from the main series.
Pokémon with multiple forms, such as Vulpix and Meowth, have all their forms available.

# Known Issues #
* Meowth's Alolan and Galarian forms currently lack their own sprites, so still look like regular Meowth.
* Some of the newer gen Pokémon lack sprites other then their portrait.
* Some evos lack sprites.
